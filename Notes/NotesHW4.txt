Psuedo Code for implementation Level 2 Words

	Take the input of a string

	Find the length of that string

	Create an empty string and concat the first letter of the input string followed by a space.

	Return that final string


Looking to create a buffer for numbers so decided to create another function that inputs numbers into an array.  

Found that the append function is how you add on to an existing array.  

The . is actually couting as a spot in my program when I'm trying to find the max length.

Having trouble with the backslash escapses.  Python is not recognizes them as it prints so I'm having issues with changing it into 
a raw literal.

My backslash escape requires two backslash in order to function properly. I talked with Sean Debbellis and was able to compile a list of backslash Escapes list.

I am questioning my pad with character because I'm not totally sure exactly what the output should be, however I am confident that my program is building it correctly if I'm using the same style of equal width to print out.  

Updated my styling to reflect the pep-00008 Standard as from this website http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length

Decided to move onto school linux to make use of the seq file for testing older  implementations
