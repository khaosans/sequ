Usage: seq [OPTION]... LAST
  or:  seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
  or:  seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST
Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

  -f, --format=FORMAT      use printf style floating-point FORMAT
  -s, --separator=STRING   use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)
  -w, --equal-width        equalize width by padding with leading zeroes
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit
  -W, --words    take a word and put spaces between each letter
  -p, --pad      Output the sequence with elements padded on the left to be all of equal width
  -P, --pad-spaces         Output the sequence with elements padded with spaces on the left to be all of equal width.

If FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an
omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when LAST is smaller than FIRST.
FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating point values.
INCREMENT is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and
INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is greater than LAST.
FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument of type `double';
it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed point
decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise.
