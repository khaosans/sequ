Each item has 3 parts to process:

Create a format Print function:
	Function takes in three arguments as strings and converts them into either ints or floats:
	Check to see which value is given
	Take those values and print acording the the input
Create a seq print function that takes in three arguments
	Check to see which values are given
	takes those values and prints according to the input
create a equalwidth function and takes three inputs
	checkt o see which values are given
	takes those values and prints accordingly


Each system call needs to account for each of these cases:
if the inputstring is equal to --format or -f
	When Argument is one number
		call the print format function with one arguemnt and the rest are filled in
	When Argument include begining and end
		call the print format function with 2 arguments and the rest are filled in
	when Argument include beggining increment and end
		call the print format function with 3 arguments 
if the inputstring is equal to --seperator or -s
	When Argument is one number
		call the print seq function with one arguemnt and the rest are filled in
	When Argument include begining and end
		call the print seq function with 2 arguments and the rest are filled in
	when Argument include beggining increment and end
		call the print seq function with 3 arguments
if the inputstring is equal to --equal-width or -w
	When Argument is one number
		call the print equalwidth function with one arguemnt and the rest are filled in
	When Argument include begining and end
		call the print equalwidth function with 2 arguments and the rest are filled in
	when Argument include beggining increment and end
		call the print equalwidth function with 3 arguments
if the inputstring is equal to --help
	print the help document screen
if the inputstring is equal to --version
	print the version document to screen
